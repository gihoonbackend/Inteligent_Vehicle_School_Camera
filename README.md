# Commands for practicing OpenCV(Python) based on ROS.

<br>

**Note: This practice was conducted in an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and ROS(Robot Operating System) 1 Noetic environment.** <br><br>

**To set up the project, follow these steps:** <br><br>

# 1. Install libraries related to 'OpenCV'
  
  <br>
  
  ```shell
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
  **or**
  ```shell
  pip3 install opencv-python
  ```
  <br>
  
  ```shell
  pip install numpy
  ```
  <br><br>

# 2. Create a package for practicing OpenCV in the ROS Noetic environment
  
  <br>
  
  ```shell
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  ```
  ```shell
  catkin_create_pkg opencv_test rospy std_msgs sensor_msgs cv_bridge
